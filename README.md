# Practice_C++

***If you don't know anything about codeing and C++ language then you should take someone's help who do know about it***

This is my CPP practice zone where I use to push my learned code. Here [tut(number).cpp] is the learning files. Here most of the code are comment out by this symbol "//" anyone can remove it and use them to learn what the code is about but make sure to comment out other code part.
